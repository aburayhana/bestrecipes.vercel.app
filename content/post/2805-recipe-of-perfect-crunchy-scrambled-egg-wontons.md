Immediately after adding to pan move them around for just a moment so the wonton doesn&#39;t get stuck to the pan. Once they start frying they won&#39;t stick, it&#39;s only when they 1st hit the pan."
- "After a minute or 2, use thongs and turn your wontons over. Cook both side so they are nice and browned."
