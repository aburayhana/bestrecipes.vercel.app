- "150 g flour"
- "30 g sugar"
- "1 tsp yeast"
- " Water to activate yeast"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "2 tsp butter or coconut oil"
- "1 large purple sweet potato about 150g"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the dough: activate the yeast, then mix flour, yeast mixture, sugar, baking powder and butter and knead for about 15 minutes until it doesn&#39;t feel incredibly sticky anymore. Add more water if you need."
- "When you&#39;ve got a nice dough let if proof for half an hour (or longer) in a warm place. Alternatively let it proof in the fridge over night, you want the dough to have nearly doubled in size."
- "Peel and chop the sweet potato into even cubes. Steam for 20 minutes, then mash into a paste. Add some water and if you want a sweeter filling add sugar."
- "Let the paste cool down slightly and shape the purple mash into 8 even balls for the dumpling filling."

- "One by one put a flat dough circle onto your hand and place a potato ball in the middle of it. Seal the dumplings, trying to keep the filling central. The side with the seal will be the dumpling&#39;s bottom."
- "Place each sealed dumpling on a piece of baking paper and cut a little cross on the top so the filling shines through."
- "Let the sealed dumplings proof for another 10-15 minutes and then steam them for 15 minutes."
- "Enjoy! They can be eaten hot or cold and keep in the fridge for a few days."
