recipeingredient:
- "1 lb fresh ground pork unsalted"
- "1/2 cup finely shredded carrots"
- "1/2 cup finely shredded green cabbage"
- "1/3 cup minced yellow onion"
- "2 cloves minced garlic"
- "2 tbsp soy sauce"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 tsp black pepper"
- "30 wrappers"
recipeinstructions:
- "Over medium heat, brown the pork until done. Break up any large chunks. Stir in soy sauce, garlic powder, and black pepper for an additional minute or two. Taste a sample. If additional salt or pepper is needed, now is the time to add it. Drain meat and set aside to cool. (Since I have high blood pressure, I try to use as little salt as possible and find soy sauce alone to be salty enough.)"
- "Keeping the remaining liquids, heat onions, garlic, and carrots until onions begin to caramelize and carrots soften. Drain off any remaining liquid."
- "Turn off heat, add back pork and add cabbage. Mix together using residual heat for two minutes. Remove mixture and set aside to further cool."
- "Roll cooled mixture into 1/2 rolls using wax paper, piping bag, or sausage stuffer. Cut into 3 to 4 inch lengths, then wrap with spring roll or lumpia wrappers."
- "Traditionally, lumpia are fried in vegetable oil until all sides are golden brown. I personally have problems with deep fried foods, so instead I put them in a convection toaster oven for 5 to 7 minutes. Serve with a sweet chili sauce like Mae Ploy."
