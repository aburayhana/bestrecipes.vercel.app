recipeinstructions:

- "Cover and keep the dough aside for 15 to 20 minutes to set. Again knead and smooth the dough for 2 to 3 minutes. Break the lumps from the dough then make small dough balls and give them a round shape. Then press it and give it a shape of a peda."
- "To roll out the sheets take a rolling board. Roll the dough ball into round shape with 3 to 4 inch diameter. Dust it again if it sticks to the rolling board. Once rolled out and ready, place it out on a plate. Do the same for remaining dough"
- "Spread a little oil over the round sheets on all sides. Then sprinkle a little dry refined flour over it and spread it. Place one sheet over another sticking the edges. Press them with hand and stick. Now roll it again to make very thin sheets of a diameter of 7 to 8 inch"
- "Heat the girdle and grease it with a little oil. Wipe out extra oil with a tissue and keep the flame very low. Once the girdle is hot, place the sheets to roast and let it roast slightly both sides. Once done, place it out on a board and separate the wrappers. Open it from the joints. Transparent and thin wrappers are ready."

- "Brush both sides of the wrappers with melted ghee. Place them in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes at 180 C. Carefully turn them around, taking care, as the air fryer will be hot and fry them for another 5 mins or until edges are golden brown."
- "Let it cool. Remove from the air fryer and brush with the honey."
