recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all of the ingredients with the exception of water, oil, butter and the won ton wrappers (smartass). Set aside in the fridge covered in plastic (this can be done ahead of time)"
- "Place a small spoonful (1 teaspoon-ish?) of the filling in the center of a won ton wrapper. Dip your finger in some warm water and run along the edges of the wrapper. You don&#39;t want it sopping wet, just sticky. Bring up all of the corners, working in a counter-clockwise fashion (it doesn&#39;t matter, thats just how I do it) and pinch the seams together, ensuring you press out all of the air, and the pot-stickers are sealed completely. Set these aside under a damp kitchen towel until ready."
- "Bring a small drizzle of oil to temperature over medium/medium-high heat and place in the pot-stickers. Let fry until the bottoms begin to turn golden brown. Once achieved, dump in approximately 2-3 tablespoons of water and immediately cover. Steam for 3 minutes."
- "Blot out any excess water and quickly add a bit of butter. Fry for a bit longer, continually checking the bottoms of the won tons to ensure you are not burning them (ride the heat throttle to compensate). Once they are fried to your liking, remove to a paper towel lined plate and serve with soy sauce and more sliced green onion!"
