- "Potato : Boiled potatoes until half-cooked then peel the potato&#39;s skin. Cut in half and scrape a portion of potato side and fill it with the filling. Steam it. If you want simple way, just boiled it and peel the potato skin without fill it with the feeling."
- "Tofu : Cut in half and scrape a portion of tofu and fill it with the filling. Steam. You can also just cut in half and directly steam it."
- "Bitter melon : Cut in several pieces (as your liking). Scrape the seed portion and fill it in with the filling. Steam it."

- "Peanut Sauce (Peanut Sambal) :  Process the peanuts in food processor until smooth. Transfer it into a medium bowl. Set aside. Process red chilies, garlic and shallots until smooth.

Add salt, coconut sugar, tamarind juice, mix well. Wait until the sauce become thick then turn off the heat. Set aside."
