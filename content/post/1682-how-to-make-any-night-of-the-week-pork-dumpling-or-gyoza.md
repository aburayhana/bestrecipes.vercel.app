- "Mix well and knead the mixture with hand until it all combined."
- "Take a wrapper and place it in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Use a teaspoon to take a small amount of filling and put it in the centre of the wrapper. Dip one finger in a bowl of water and draw a circle around the outer ¼” of the wrapper with your wet finger until it’s wet all around."
- "Folding Method (Toward Centre) 1.	Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it in the centre with your fingers.

Immediately cover with a lid and steam the gyoza for about 3 minutes or until most of the water evaporates.

- "Remove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. Add 1 tsp sesame oil around the frying pan. Cook uncovered until the gyoza is nice and crisp on the bottom."
- "Transfer to a plate and serve with dipping sauce. For the dipping sauce, combine the sauce ingredients in a small plate and mix all together."
