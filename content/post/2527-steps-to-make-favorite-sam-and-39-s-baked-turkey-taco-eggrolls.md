recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground turkey"
- "1 1/2 cup broccoli slaw shredded broccoli and carrot mix"
- "1 1/4 cup shredded Colby cheese"
- "1/2 tsp freshly shredded ginger root"
- "4 tbsp Sams Taco Seasoning or your favorite taco seasoning mix"
- "2 tbsp water"
- "1 tbsp cornstarch"
- "4 tbsp reduced sodium soy sauce"
- "12 egg roll wrappers"
recipeinstructions:
- "On medium high heat, brown ground turkey and 2 tbsp of Sam&#39;s Taco Seasoning. Do not drain. Once cooked through, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels."
- "In same pan over medium high heat add broccoli slaw, ginger and soy sauce. Mix well."
- "Mix water and cornstarch until dissolved and add to broccoli slaw mix. Stir until incorporated well and sauce begins to thicken and cook off. I made this recipe to coat the broccoli slaw with flavor not a thick sauce so you shouldn&#39;t have a runny sauce at the bottom of your pan."
- "Once the broccoli slaw mix is tender yet still crunchy, add the turkey back into the pan and add the remaining 2 tbsp of taco seasoning. Stir well and add a tablespoon of water if needed. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes then remove from heat to cool."
- "Preheat oven to 375°F."
- "Lay out egg roll wrappers and shredded cheese next to your working space."
- "Place a small bowl of water next to your wrappers as well to seal the seams of your egg rolls."
- "Place an egg roll wrapper in front of you facing up like a diamond. Add 3-4 tablespoons of the broccoli slaw mix to the middle of the egg roll wrapper. Add 2-3 tablespoons shredded cheese over filling. Now take the bottom point of the wrapper and fold over the middle upwards over the filling and tuck back behind the filling. Fold in the corner points on the sides to the middle and then finish rolling the entire roll upwards. Once you&#39;ve rolled the whole egg roll, dip your finger in water and moisten the inside of the top point to seal the egg roll and keep it from coming apart while cooking."
- "Spray both sides of the egg roll with non stick cooking spray and place on a parchment paper or foil lined baking sheet."
- "Bake for 8 minutes each side turning halfway through for even cooking. Remove from oven, let cool and garnish with extra cheese, salsa and sour cream or your favorite taco toppings. Enjoy!"
