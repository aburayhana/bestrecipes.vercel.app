- "top each bowl with an even amount of the topping until it&#39;s gone"
- "if you have wonton layers protruding above the filling, either tuck them down or fold in a little, but they don&#39;t have to be perfectly even with the filling"

- "they&#39;ll be done when you can see the filling &#34;bubbling&#34; and the topping has browned and gotten crispy"
- "for a more crispy topping, turn the heat up to 400 and bake another few minutes, just keep an eye on them so they don&#39;t burn"
- "you can eat these warm, or let them cool and freeze or refrigerate them and enjoy later :) I enjoy them for breakfast!"
