- "2 cloves garlic chopped"
- "2 cups mashed potstoes"
- "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese"
- "3 green onions finely sliced"
- " Premade wonton wrappers"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add a small knob of butter to a small pan on medium heat. Add the garlic and fry for 1 minute, just long enough to take away the raw garlic bite."
- "Put the garlic, mashed potatoes, cheese and green onion in a mixing bowl, along with a good pinch of salt and a good pinch of ground white pepper. Fold the mash into itself several times until everything is combined."
- "Form spring rolls using the wonton wrappers, and 1 1/2 tbsp of potato mixture at a time. There are many videos online on how to wrap spring rolls properly. You should end up with about 18 rolls. Put them in a freezer for 30 minutes to set."
