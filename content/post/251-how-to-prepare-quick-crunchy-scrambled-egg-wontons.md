- "add eggs, salt, pepper, basil, onion salt, and scramble into the hotdogs. (Add seasonings to your own desired taste. I go light for my little ones)"
- "once scramble is done, remove from heat, and add shredded cheese"
- "let the scramble cool for just a moment before you fill your wonton wraps. I like to remove the scramble from the hot pan to a cool bowl to speed up the cooling a bit"
- "use small 1/2 spoonfuls of the scramble and begin filling and folding your wraps. Keep a bowl of water beside you. It&#39;s best to keep the wraps and your fingers moist so the wraps stay closed."
- "heat oil in a frying pan. I like to make 5 wontons at a time so its easier to monitor and cook evenly. Once the oils nice and hot, add wontons. Immediately after adding to pan move them around for just a moment so the wonton doesn&#39;t get stuck to the pan. Once they start frying they won&#39;t stick, it&#39;s only when they 1st hit the pan."
- "After a minute or 2, use thongs and turn your wontons over. Cook both side so they are nice and browned."
