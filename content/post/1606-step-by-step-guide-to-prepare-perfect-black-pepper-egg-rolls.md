- "Disclaimer, I am terrible at rolling egg rolls, spring rolls and folding dumplings. But make a fold over the filling one time, fold in the sides, roll the rest of the way. Place on wax paper"
- "I don&#39;t deep fry, if you do, go ahead, they will probably come out better, but I am pan frying. Heat oil in pan, add rolls, don&#39;t overcrowd. I used medium heat."
- "I flipped mine after about 4 minutes, just monitor yours and flip when the right color."
- "Nothing beats a plate full of these to munch on."
- "Dipping sauce, i like yellow mustard (i know, but that&#39;s just me). Asian soy sauce based is ok also, or Vietnamese fish sauce based is good. Do what you like. My daughter likes mayo, go figure."
