recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground pork"
- "1/2 cup cooked or raw shrimp peeled deveined finely chopped"
- "4 garlic cloves"
- "1/2 cup onion finely chopped"
- "1/4 cup green onion finely chopped"
- "1/2 cup carrot finely chopped"
- "1/4 cup celery finely chopped"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "2 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1/4 cup soy sauce Kikkoman preferably"
- "1 package spring roll wrappers NOT egg roll wrappers"
- "1 frying oil ie peanut oil"
- "2 eggs"
- "1 sweet Thai chili sauce for dipping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Thaw the frozen spring roll wrappers ahead of time by simply taking them out of the freezer and setting them aside at room temperature."
- "Add all ingredients (MINUS the spring roll wrappers, oil, and one egg) in a bowl. We will save the second egg for egg wash later."
- "Mix all ingredients very well. I used a clean hand to do this step."
- "Create an egg wash by beating the leftover egg with 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl."
- "The wrappers I bought were 10&#34; squares. They should be pliable before you separate them. Lay one flat on a clean surface with a corner pointing towards you. In other words, the square wrapper should be oriented in a diamond shape."
- "Take about a tablespoon and a half of the mix, and lay it out across the center of the wrapper. Create a thin log about half an inch tall. The log should not extend to the corners of the wrapper. Leave about 2&#34; of wrapper for covering either end of the log."
- "Pick up the corner closest to you, and fold the wrapper over and snug against the log."
- "Fold the left and right corners over to cover the ends of the log."
- "Firmly, but gently, continue to roll the log forward. Make sure you do this as snugly as possible. Before you reach the remaining corner, dab some egg wash on it with your fingertip, and finish the roll."
- "Repeat steps 5-9 for the rest of the mixture. Don&#39;t worry if you have leftover wrappers. Worry if you have leftover mixture lol."
- "You can fry this a couple of ways: 1) deep fry at 350° or 2) pan fry on a stove with high heat and enough oil to submerge a roll halfway. The second method will obviously require you to turn the rolls over midway."
- "If deep frying, drop in one roll at a time. I had a gallon of peanut oil in a deep pot, so I was able to cook all the rolls in one go. Remember, do not fill any pot more than halfway with oil when deep frying. Once the rolls are in, time for 10 minutes or until golden brown."
- "If pan frying, fry each roll 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown."
- "Remove from oil, allow to cool, cut each roll in half with kitchen shears, and serve with sweet Thai chili sauce!"
