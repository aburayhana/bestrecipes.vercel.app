- "Cut the spring roll wrappers in half with a pair of kitchen scissors to make 20 wrappers."
- "Mix together the cream cheese, mentaiko, and black pepper. I used the mentaiko shown in the photo, which I found at Costco. You can make these without mentaiko if you&#39;d prefer though."
- "Spread a strip of mentaiko-cheese paste onto one edge of the spring roll wrapper and line up 4 edamame beans on top (as shown in the photo). Roll the spring rolls up and place them seam-down. (If you place them seam-down you don&#39;t have to worry about fixing the loose edge in place.)"

- "To toast the spring rolls, place a sheet of aluminum foil in an oven and toast the spring rolls seam-down for 4-5 minutes. Then flip them over and toast for a further 2-3 minutes. Keep an eye on the rolls so that they don&#39;t burn. Once they&#39;ve browned, they&#39;re ready to serve."
- "Eat them whilst they&#39;re hot and crispy"
