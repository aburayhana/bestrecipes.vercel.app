- "This is the chili oil I used. Use with caution. It is SPICY. Start with a little and add more until you get the heat level you want. I like my wonton soup really spicy so I used about 2 tablespoons in the sauce mix. I already list a chili garlic sauce (also pictured below) which packs a punch by itself. So be prepared when adding this as it is a lot of additional heat!"
