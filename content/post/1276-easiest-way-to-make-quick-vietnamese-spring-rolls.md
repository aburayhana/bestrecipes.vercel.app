- "To make the fish sauce : mix all the ingredients. Stir until the sugar dissolved. Taste it. Add sugar and water as needed to adjust the taste because every different fish sauce brand has different saltiness."
- "Serve the rolls with either one of the sauces or both. I prefer to have both sauce for my rolls because the combination of both flavor is just amazing."
