recipeingredient:
- "60 gr all purpose flour"
- "50 gr wheat starch"
- "1 tbs tapioca flour"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "75 ml hot boiling water"
- "1/2 tbs cooking oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix well flour, wheat starch and salt."
- "Add the oil to the hot water. Stir it."
- "Pour the mixture to the flour (add as much of the water as necessary to form a dough. Add more water than the recipe calls for if the dough is too dry. The texture should be like pie dough. So be carefull not to add too much water, it will make the wonton not crispy). Stir it with wooden spoon/fork. When it becomes together, knead the dough until elastic (doesn&#39;t stick to the hand anymore)."
- "Round the dough, wrap it in plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature for 15 minutes."
- "Divide the dough into 4 - 6 parts. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and use a rolling pin to flatten the dough until the dough is thin enough to be fed through the pasta machine."
- "Flatten the dough using the pasta machine starting from no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then 6."
- "Cut the flattened dough into 4-inch squares and sprinkle some flour on both sides of the wonton wrappers to prevent the wrappers from sticking to each other."
- "Put the wonton wrappers into a plastic bag or airtight container as soon as possible to stop them from drying out. Store in the refrigerator or freezer until ready to use."
