recipeinstructions:
- "Make filling, to get rid of some water of cabbage leaves, after finely chopped them, sprinkle salt to dehydrate the cabbage, leave it for 10-15 min and squeeze the water out. Transfer to another bowl and tip the water out."
- "Cut green onions and shiitake mushrooms into small pieces."
- "Combine the ground meat, cabbage, green onion, and shiitake mushrooms in a large bowl."

- "Add the seasonings (1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp sake, and freshly ground black pepper)."
- "Mix well and knead the mixture with hand until it all combined."
- "Take a wrapper and place it in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Use a teaspoon to take a small amount of filling and put it in the centre of the wrapper. Dip one finger in a bowl of water and draw a circle around the outer ¼” of the wrapper with your wet finger until it’s wet all around."
- "Folding Method (Toward Centre) 1.	Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it in the centre with your fingers. Using your thumb and index finger, start making a pleat about once every half of inch to the top part of the wrapper from the centre toward the right.

Immediately cover with a lid and steam the gyoza for about 3 minutes or until most of the water evaporates. (At this stage you can add about 1 tbsp of corn flour in the water and mix well before pour water in, this will give an extra crisp around the corners of the dumpling)"
- "Remove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. Add 1 tsp sesame oil around the frying pan. Cook uncovered until the gyoza is nice and crisp on the bottom."
- "Transfer to a plate and serve with dipping sauce. For the dipping sauce, combine the sauce ingredients in a small plate and mix all together."
