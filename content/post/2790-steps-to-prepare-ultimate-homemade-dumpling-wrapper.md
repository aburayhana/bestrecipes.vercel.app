recipeingredient:
- "3 cup plain flour"
- "1 cup warm water may not need it all"
- "1 tsp vegetable cooking oil"
- "1 tsp salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a mixing bowl, add all ingredients together and start to knead for 6-8 minutes until smooth. Form your dough into a small ball."
- "To make the dough work, it’s better to make it a bit tougher than softer. The key is to rest your dough for at least 30min to an hour and it will become soft enough to work with. But if the dough is too soft, it’ll be difficult to wrap and the dumplings won’t keep their shape."
- "To make sure that the dumplings are the same in size, you can weigh each piece of dough before rolling it out. Aim for 9 to 10 grams per piece if you want dumplings with a thinner skin."
- "Dust your working surface with flour before you start rilling out your wrapper. Take one piece of dough and press it to a round disc. Hold the wrapper with your less dominant hand and hold the rolling pin with dominant hand. Rotate the wrapper when moving your rolling pin. Repeat the process, rotate the wrapper-roll and rotate the wrapper-roll."
- "The wrappers will have thicker center and thinner edges naturally. The wrapper should be around 8cm to 10cm in diameter. Dust your dumpling wrapper one at the time to be able to stake them in pile without them sticking together."
