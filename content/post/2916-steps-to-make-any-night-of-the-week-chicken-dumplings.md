recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl mix together chicken mince with the ginger and garlic paste, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil and rice vinegar.

Rub the edges of the wrapper with water and then fold the dough to create a half moon shape and press it down firmly to seal.

- "When they are ready to be made, heat some oil in a large non stick skillet. Place the dumplings in a single layer (i.e. not overlapping) and cook over medium low heat. You want them crispy and golden brown. It took me less than 5mins to cook them."
- "Serve right away with some soy sauce."
- "Make sure you store the dumplings you haven&#39;t cooked in a sealed ziploc bag and leave them in the freezer until the next time you have an asian craving."
