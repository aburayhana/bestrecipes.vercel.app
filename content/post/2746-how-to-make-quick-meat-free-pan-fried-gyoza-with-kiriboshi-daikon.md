- "1 tsp Katakuriko"
- "1 look at the steps Sesame oil for stirfrying the filling ingredients and panfrying gyoza"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
- "20 Gyoza dumpling skins"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the kiriboshi daikon in water for 5 minutes to rehydrate. Cut the kiriboshi daikon into 5-mm pieces. Cut the shiitake mushrooms into 5-mm-dices. Chop the Japanese leek into slightly smaller dices. Grate the ginger and keep only the juice."
- "Heat 2 tablespoons of sesame oil in a frying pan and add the kiriboshi daikon and shiitake mushrooms and fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the ● seasonings and fry until the excess moisture has evaporated."
- "After the moisture has evaporated, (do not allow the mixture to get too dry) add the ginger juice, Japanese leek and Chinese garlic chives. Season with pepper and stir gently. Turn off the heat. Leave to cool."
- "After cooling, wrap the gyoza dumpling skins around the filling. The filling will reduce in size when it is cooked, so use much more filling than for a normal gyoza. Otherwise the end product will be too flat."
- "Prepare the water mixture used to finish pan-frying the gyoza. Dissolve the plain flour and katakuriko with a tiny amount of water (not listed) to make a paste. Stir in the hot water to the paste."
- "Heat the frying pan really well first and add the vegetable oil. Swirl the frying pan and allow the oil to completely coat the frying pan. Arrange the gyoza and fry over a medium heat. After the bottom of the gyoza has browned,  add the prepared water mixture (I use 100 ml or less of the water mixture at a time). Cover with a lid and cook until all the water has evaporated."
- "Uncover the lid and pour in the sesame oil. Fry further until the bottom of the gyoza is very crispy. After that,  transfer the gyoza onto a serving plate and serve immediately."
