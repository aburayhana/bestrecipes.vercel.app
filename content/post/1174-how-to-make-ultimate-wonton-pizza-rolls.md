recipeingredient:
- "1 packages square wonton wrappers"
- "1 jar Barilla marinara sauce or your favorite marinara sauce"
- "1 shredded mozerella cheese"
- "1 packages pepperoni slices quartered or mini pepperoni"
- "1 1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs"
- "1 small cup of water"
- "1 egg beaten"
- "1 canola oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by taking wonton wrapper and putting 1/4 tsp. of marinara sauce on one corner of the wrapper facing you. Layer with pepperoni and mozerella cheese."
- "Take your finger, dip it in water and lightly moisten all 4 edges of the wonton wrapper around filling."
- "Take the corner of the wrapper facing you and fold upwards towards the top corner about halfway."
- "Tuck in each side of the wrapper over the folded corner and roll towards the top corner to seal the roll."
- "Dip the rolled pizza roll into the beaten egg, then breadcrumbs."
- "Fill, roll and bread all wonton wrappers before frying, as they cook quickly. Set aside in a single layer on paper plates so they dont stick to each other. If the wonton wrappers dry out a little that&#39;s fine, they&#39;re easier to handle that way."
- "Heat about 2 to 3 inches of canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. If oil is too hot, filling will bust out of the wrappers so watch your heat closely."
- "Fry each pizza roll on each side 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly golden brown. Drain on paper towels."
- "Serve with remaining marinara sauce or ranch dressing. Enjoy!"
