Refer to picture. First place a spoon of minced in middle. Fold in half then make 3 folds towards the middle on both sides. Make a curve with your thumb so the dumplings looks like a moon shape. Goodluck practise makes perfect haha."
- "Usually ill freeze them and share it with friends as they can cook it themselves. To cook them add abit of oil in pan, place dumplings in straight up. Fry for 1 min until bottom golden brown then add hot boiling water into the pan so the dumplings in shallow water, lid covered and cook for 8 mins. If theres still water in the pan open lid cook until water evaporates crispy bottom. Serve hot with chinese black or red vinegar. Another lazy way is boil until cooked served in chicken broth. Done!"
