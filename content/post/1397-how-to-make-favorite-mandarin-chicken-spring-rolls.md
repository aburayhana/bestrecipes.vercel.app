recipeingredient:
- "2 chicken breasts boneless skinless"
- "1 Toasted Sesame Dressing"
- "6 lettuce your favorite variety"
- "2 bok choy"
- "6 green onions"
- "1 cup mung bean sprouts approx"
- "1 cucumber"
- "1 can mandarin orange segments drained"
- "1 packages rice paper spring roll wrappers"
- " toasted sesame seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Marinade the chicken breasts in my Toasted Sesame Dressing for several hours or overnight.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/340413-toasted-sesame-dressing"
- "Cook the chicken breasts on a grill (best method) or under your broiler, basting frequently with the marinade. You want them cooked through with a tasty char on the outside. Chill completely when done cooking. (I do this the day before I want to make the spring rolls.)"
- "Slice the chilled chicken breasts in thin strips, and prepare and plate the rest of the ingredients as shown in the photo. The cucumber is partially peeled, seeded, and sliced in strips. The green onion tops are sliced in strips (I saved the white bottom part for a fried rice side dish)."
- "Fill a rice paper water bowl (shown in the photo) or other container with warm water. Quickly moisten one rice paper wrap in the water. You don&#39;t want to leave it in long at all, just a few seconds to get it wet all over. It will still be somewhat stiff, but it continues to soften and become pliable as you&#39;re filling it."
- "Lay the moistened rice paper on a plate and top it with the fillings."
- "Roll it up tightly egg roll style."
- "Serve with a dipping dish of Toasted Sesame Dressing with some toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on top. Enjoy!"
- "About Mung Bean Sprouts: If you have a reliable source for sprouts, I recommend buying them rather than sprouting your own. My grocer no longer carries them because they were frequently contaminated, which he said is a fairly common problem. So I sprout my own."
- "It takes a full week to sprout the beans to a good size, as shown in the photo, rinsing and tending them 2 to 3 times a day. When fully sprouted, it&#39;s a tedious task to prep them my removing the sprouted seed and any root hairs. Took me over an hour to prep the amount shown in the photo."
- "They&#39;re healthy and delicious, and I love them, so I don&#39;t mind the time and effort. But if I could buy safe sprouts at my market rather than sprouting my own I would!"
