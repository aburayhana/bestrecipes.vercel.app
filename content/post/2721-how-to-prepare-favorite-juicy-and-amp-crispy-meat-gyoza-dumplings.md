- "1 Pepper"
- "20 largesized Gyoza dumpling skins"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add soy sauce and Chinese chicken stock powder (if you dissolve in hot water, use once it cools down) and mix well until the mixture becomes elastic. Cover with cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for about 1 to 2 hours."
- "Chop the Chinese cabbage roughly and rub with 1 teaspoon of salt. Squeeze the excess moisture gently. Chop the garlic chives and grate the ginger and garlic."

- "When the skins start to brown (if they don&#39;t look crispy, uncover and turn up the heat to high. Evaporate excess water in the pan), add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil from the side of the frying pan to crisp the skins. Cover and fry for 2 to 3 minutes."
- "This looks very crispy. I used a 20 cm frying pan. I also used sifted flour without lumps and dissolved 2 teaspoons of it in 50 ml water."
