Add about 2-3 tbs filling to bottom third of wrapper (I just eyeballed the filling). Brush 2 top edges with eggwash (about 1/4 inch wide)."
- "Roll up tightly by first folding bottom corner up over filling, then fold over left and right corners toward center. Continue rolling toward last edge. Gently press to seal. Transfer to a platter, sealed edge down. Repeat steps 5 &amp; 6 with remaining wrappers and filling."
- "While assembling eggrolls have your deep fryer or a large heavy-bottomed pot of oil heating to 350°F (do not fill either more than half way with oil)."
- "Fry eggrolls in batches until crisp and golden, about 4-5 minutes. When done transfer to paper towel lined plate. Let rest while you make the pepper gravy."
- "In a small sauce pan melt butter over medium-high heat. Wisk in flour, cook about 1 minute. Wisk in flour and cook, wisking constantly, until thickened. Add pepper and onion powder. Salt to taste. Serve as dipping sauce with your eggrolls. Enjoy!"
