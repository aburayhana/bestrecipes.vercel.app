- "Spread a strip of mentaiko-cheese paste onto one edge of the spring roll wrapper and line up 4 edamame beans on top (as shown in the photo). Roll the spring rolls up and place them seam-down. (If you place them seam-down you don&#39;t have to worry about fixing the loose edge in place.)"

- "Eat them whilst they&#39;re hot and crispy"
