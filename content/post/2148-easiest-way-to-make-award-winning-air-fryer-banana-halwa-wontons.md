recipeinstructions:

- "Spread a little oil over the round sheets on all sides. Then sprinkle a little dry refined flour over it and spread it. Place one sheet over another sticking the edges. Press them with hand and stick. Now roll it again to make very thin sheets of a diameter of 7 to 8 inch"
- "Heat the girdle and grease it with a little oil. Wipe out extra oil with a tissue and keep the flame very low. Once the girdle is hot, place the sheets to roast and let it roast slightly both sides. Once done, place it out on a board and separate the wrappers. Open it from the joints.

- "Let it cool. Remove from the air fryer and brush with the honey."
