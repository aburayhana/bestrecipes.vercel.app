- "2 large carrots"
- "2 cucumbers"
- "1 package spring roll wrappers you probably wont use all of them at once"
- "15 oz baby spinach"
- "1 head romaine lettuce"

recipeinstructions:
- "Boil a big pot of water. Remove from heat and drop in your noodles. Stir them a bit to separate them. After 3 minutes, strain the noodles and rinse with cold water."
- "Wash the spinach and spin it dry."
- "Pick the leaves from the bunch of mint."
- "Julienne the carrot and cucumber. This is the tough part. A little bit of grunt work if you&#39;re not a pro yet."
- "Gather your ingredients. I like to put them in bowls so it&#39;s easier to work, kinda like a springroll factory. Even better if you have some helpers."
- "Now for the rolling process. You take a springroll wrapper and submerge it in a bowl of water until it gets floppy, then lay it out on a clean surface."
- "Tear up some mint and lay it on the wrapper. Arrange your other ingredients on top. Just like making a sandwich, you get to decide how much of each ingredient you like. I like to try and block the carrots from the wrapper with spinach or mint because they have harsh edges and may tear through the wrapper. Alternatively, you can use 2 wrappers per springroll if you like."
- "Once you&#39;ve got your ingredients stacked up, roll it like a burrito. Pull in the sides, tuck the fillings, and roll it up."
- "Ready to eat. Serve with some type of Southeast Asian inspired sauce. I like to make a sweet peanuty dipping sauce, but sriracha and some type of chili/vinegar concoction would go great as well."
